/* TODO: Create a startup window for the app.
*
* Startup window should contain:
* - Logo
* - App name
* - Combo box for allowed game profiles (Gothic, Gothic II NOTR, Gothic II Classic?, Gothic
* Sequel?)
* - Selectable list box with available instances for the game profile
* - Button to browse for select game directory
* - Button to add an instance for the game profile into the list
* - Button to remove an instance from the list
* - Button to start the app
*
*     After user runs the main app, startup window should appear. User then will have to select a
* desired game profile and provide a path to the game directory. Then, he should either create a
* new instance of the game with an arbitrary name or select an existing one from the list. After
* that, he should be able to start the main app.
*
*     Upon startup window creation, the list of instances should be loaded from the config file if
* it exists, otherwise a new one should be initiliazed.
